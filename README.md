# TodoList
I'm excited to share the successful completion of my  task: building a functional To-Do List Android application! ðŸš€

This project involved creating a user-friendly interface with features like:

Adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

Setting task priorities (with visual indicators!).

Implementing a reminder system with notifications (including a fix for those pesky delayed alerts ðŸ˜‰).

Basic profile settings.

A clean and soft themed UI (logo and background designed by yours truly!).

This experience has been an incredible learning journey, providing hands-on experience with Android development using Kotlin, Room persistence library, AlarmManager for notifications, and UI/UX principles.
